# The "Skillset"

#### March 2023

I've been writing code at [CoinMetrics](https://www.coinmetrics.io) for about 8 months - feels like a good time to reflect a bit on what I've learned.

Of course there's technical knowledge - timing of events, browser render processes, http protocol, DOM apis, `Object.keys()` vs `Object.getOwnProperties()`, Gitlab CI/CD configuration. The list goes on.

But from my perspective, those resume-worthy knowledge-bites have been far less profound than the skill of navigating complex code. When I started I remember saying I felt like I was dropped into a very big maze with a very small headlamp. At this point, I don't necessarily feel like the headlamp is _that_ much bigger, but I do feel more adept at navigating the maze.

A lot of this is just getting more comfortable with the tools made available by my text editor. Jumping around, keeping track of where I have been, navigating through common files. When I was a math teacher, organization was done in physical space: where I laid out certain papers, how I clipped certain papers together, physical folders in a physical box. Everything was _visible_. Maybe I inherited a bit of my parents' wariness of "technology" but it can be challenging to stay organized when everything is just on 1 screen.

I've found [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) quite helpful in this regard - marks, the jumplist, search and replace with RegEx - all little tricks to help me access what I'm looking for without always have to remember "where" it is.

Techniques and text-editor tricks aside, I can just keep more plates spinning now. While I can't remember everything, I feel much more comfortable following breadcrumbs. Ultimately code is written 1 line at a time.

I also feel more comfortable reading code. In the past it was quite painstaking to translate code into English. In a way it feels not entirely dissimilar from learning to read music. More and more, the JavaScript itself is the best description of "what's going on?" This applies to documentation too - the ability to read a sentence, realize I understood none of it, zoom in, then back out, until I have the answer I need.

Having a more thorough conceptual understanding of web technologies has also been quite helpful. For me, it's easier to remember syntax when I know _what_ that syntax is doing at the level of browser APIs, as well as _where_ I am in the client-server ecosystem. Honestly, it took me a while to "believe" the characters I was typing on a screen could effectuate the behavior I desired. I had to spend a lot of time thinking about the abacus and the telegraph before I actually felt comfortable using `fetch`.

In the past, all of my projects were pretty much solo endeavors. They weren't _that_ complex and mostly I was starting from scratch and adding shit. At work, most of the time I'm messing around in a massively complex set of pre-existing functionality that I did not write and mostly do not understand. Tighten a screw over here. Connect a hose to a nozzle over there. Open this latch, and replace this lever, without touching the wall behind you, all in the dark. Very different set of skills than doing LeetCode problems.

And let's not forget the emotional skills. Writing code is fucking frustrating and intellectually overwhelming. I have a bachelor's degree in abstract Mathematics, but that coursework could not replicate the challenge of keeping track of all the screws I've inadvertently loosened, all the plates I've dropped on the floor, all the minutiae, all the open tabs. It's as challenging emotionally as it is intellectually sometimes, and I wish people talked about that more.

Writing code feels more like "bungee welding" than "building". I'm getting more comfortable _not_ having my feet on the ground.
