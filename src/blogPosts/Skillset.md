# The "Skillset"

#### March 2023

I've been writing code at <a target="_blank" href="https://coinmetrics.io">CoinMetrics</a> for about 8 months - feels like a good time to reflect a bit on what I've learned.

Of course there's technical knowledge - that events are fired at the time of render, not the time of DOM update. That browsers start painting pixels on the screen sooner than I sometimes want. `Object.keys()` vs `Object.getOwnProperties()`. Gitlab CI/CD configuration. The list goes on.

But those resume-worthy knowledge-bites have been far less profound (from my perspective anyway) than the skill of navigating complex code. When I started I remember saying I felt like I was dropped into a very big maze with a very small headlamp. At this point, I don't necessarily feel like the headlamp is <em>that</em> much bigger, but I do feel more adept at navigating the maze.

A lot of this involves increased comfort with my text editor. I use Vim's code folding <em>a lot</em>. This helps me go from 10,000ft view of a file to individual lines of code, and back again. It helps mitigate the feeling of being "lost" in a large file.

Vim also helps me be more comfortable being "lost." I use marks to keep track of places I know I'm going to want to come back to in a few minutes. I know in the past I was very concerned about where I was in a file, whether I needed to scroll up or down to find some function. Now I'm more often thinking about "what" I need rather than "where" it is, and using search or quifix list or marks to jump right there.

I'm learning - one painful Google search at a time - how to get `RegEx` to navigate the text like it's shapes of characters rather than written prose. It's just one of the ways I'm learning to tell my text editor to keep track of things so I don't have to.

As I continue to code, I find myself leaving little breadcrumbs for myself. I'll append `console.log`'s with `"----"` so I can find log statements that are specific to development. I'm sure that practice will evolve, but it's just cool to see how practices are developing the more code I write.

Techniques and text-editor tricks aside, I can just keep more plates spinning now. Like I can feel that my brain is more able, less to fully comprehend complexity, more to navigate complexity. I can't remember everything, but I feel much more comfortable following crumbs around and around.

I also feel more comfortable reading code. In the past it was quite painstaking to translate code into English. In a way it feels not entirely dissimilar from learning to read music. More and more, the JavaScript itself is the best description of "what's going on?" This applies to documentation too - the ability to read a sentence, realize I understood none of it, zoom in, then back out, until I have the answer I need.

In the past, all of my projects were pretty much solo endeavors. They weren't <em>that</em> complex and mostly I was starting from scratch and adding shit. Sometimes at my job I have to do this - write a UI component from scratch - but most of the time I'm messing around in a massively complex set of pre-existing functionality that I did not write and mostly do not understand. Tighten a screw over here. Connect a hose to a nozzle over there. Open this latch, and replace this lever, without touching the wall behind you, all in the dark. I really underestimated how challenging this can be, no matter how well I know the features of JavaScript.

And let's not forget the emotional skills. Writing code is fucking frustrating and intellectually overwhelming. I have a bachelor's degree in abstract Mathematics, but that coursework could not replicate the challenge of keeping track of all the screws I've inadvertently loosened, all the plates I've dropped on the floor, all the minutiae, all the open tabs. It is absolutely rewarding when something works. And, it's hard as fuck, it can be tedious as fuck. I'm getting much better at staying sane, and a little better at being relaxed.

Writing code feels more like "bungee wilding". I'm getting more comfortable <em>not</em> having my feet on the ground.
